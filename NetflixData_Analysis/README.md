# Netflix Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

In this project, I aim to improve Netflix's user experience by applying data analysis and advanced data science techniques. The goal is to build a movie recommendation system using Netflix's own dataset. By leveraging the power of data, this project seeks to enhance the way Netflix recommends movies and shows to users, ultimately driving growth and improving user satisfaction on the platform.

## Technologies Used

To achieve this, I've used the following tools and libraries:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For writing and running Python code in an interactive environment.
- **Python**: The programming language used throughout the project.
  - **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **numpy**: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
  - **matplotlib.pyplot**: For data visualization, especially to create charts and graphs.
  - **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization built on top of matplotlib.
  - **plotly.express**: For interactive visualizations and advanced charts.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

In this project, I dive into Netflix's dataset and perform various analyses to uncover insights that can improve recommendations. Here's a quick overview of what I explored:

- **Count of Movies and TV Shows**: First, I analyzed the total number of movies and TV shows in the dataset to get an understanding of its scope.
- **Rating of Shows and Movies**: I visualized the distribution of ratings across the movies and shows, helping to understand user preferences.
- **Relation Between Types and Rating**: This analysis explores how different genres or types of content (e.g., action, comedy, drama) relate to their average ratings. It helps identify which types of content tend to receive higher ratings.
- **Distribution of Types**: I also explored the distribution of movie and TV show types in the dataset to see how many shows and movies belong to each category.
- **Distribution of Ratings**: Analyzing how ratings are distributed across the dataset, this helps to identify patterns in how users rate content.

## Future Work

Moving forward, I plan to implement machine learning models to enhance the movie recommendation system. This will involve using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and other techniques to suggest content more accurately. Additionally, I aim to expand the dataset to include more diverse content, or even integrate real-time data to make the system more dynamic.
