## Project Overview  

A murder has occurred, and a detective is seeking your help to crack the case. Unfortunately, the crime scene report has been misplaced. Hereâ€™s what we remember:  

- The crime was a **murder** that happened on **January 15, 2018**, in **SQL City**.  
- The clues to solving this mystery are buried within a large SQL database.  

Your task is to query the database to retrieve the crime scene report, identify the murderer, and uncover the mastermind behind the crime.
