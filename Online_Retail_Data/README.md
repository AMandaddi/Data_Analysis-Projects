# Customer Segmentation with RFM Model

## Project Description
This project leverages retail transaction data to segment customers using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model and quantile scoring. The primary objective is to provide actionable insights for businesses to tailor customer engagement strategies based on their purchasing behaviors.

## Approach

- **RFM Analysis**: Evaluated customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary metrics.
- **Quantile Scoring**: Used to segment customers into different groups.
- **Data Preparation**: Addressed issues such as null values, duplicates, and outliers to enhance data quality.
- **Visualization**: Employed subplots to display the characteristics of each customer segment.
- **Strategic Insights**: Created tables summarizing group traits and suggesting marketing strategies.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook (Python)
- **Libraries**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Techniques

- Data analysis and cleaning
- For loops, function definitions, and conditional logic
- Data slicing and merging
- Visualization techniques and article composition

## Dataset

- **File**: `online_retail_data.csv`  
  A dataset containing 541,909 customer transactions over two years, with 8 fields.
  
- **Source**: The `online_retail_data.csv` dataset, available on **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)**, contains customer transaction data that includes customer IDs, product details, transaction dates, and purchase amounts, providing a comprehensive view of customer behavior.
